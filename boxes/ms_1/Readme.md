## How to provision a box

* Set up an Ubuntu 14.04 64bit bare box:
    * DigitalOcean
        * 1GB droplet
        * Ubuntu 14.04
* Record the following:
    * root password
    * IP address
* Provision the box using sunzi
    * Switch into sunzi dir
          cd minecraft_server/boxes/ms_1/sunzi
    * Review the settings in sunzi.yml and adjust as needed
    * Execute sunzi script
        * If you use root
              sunzi deploy root@52.5.94.110
        * If you donâ€™t use root
              sunzi deploy ubuntu@52.5.94.110 --sudo
      Enter root password if/when prompted. May not be necessary if you use public key.
    * Follow further instructions printed at the end of sunzi run


## Screen

This setup uses screen for the minecraft server process so that Mikko can attach to the process and issue minecraft commands on the server console, and can detach when his computer goes to sleep without killing the minecraft server process.
